### Things you'll need to download:
1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (be sure to install and load the "knitr"" package)
2. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account and download github [desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)


### Logs research activities in your online notebook [template found here](https://github.com/PespeniLab/Ecological-Genomics/blob/master/GithubNotebookTemplate.Rmd).   

### Common code you'll need to word process in (R)markdown  

1. To embed a link, all you need is the URL, implemented in the following way:   
```
[hyperlinked words](URL)
```

2. To embed an image, you'll need a URL of the image, implemented similarly as above:
```
![](URL)
```
To get a URL in (R)markdown:
    * go to your github repository and click **"Issues"**    
    * Click **"New"**    
    * Include a title (Pictures); click and drag any image you'd like into the comment section
    * Click **"Submit New Issue"** 
    * You will see the image, right click it and copy the URL.     

3. To include a table, it is best if you format it first as a csv(comma separated values). (Note, if on a mac, make sure the file type is unicode and unix). With the knitr package, you can generate tables easily from the csv. Here is an example: 

Grab a dataset real fast (in R)    

```{r}
#packages for reading in data
library(data.table)
#grab dataset online
dat<-fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adnguyen/HelmsCahan_CBP-partA_2016/master/Script_Analyses/Sampling_sites_table.csv")
#making a table
knitr::kable(dat[1:3])
```
