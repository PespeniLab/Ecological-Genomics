# Learning Objectives for today

1. Play with _Acartia tonsa_ reciprocal transplant gene expression data (from the Brennan et al paper we read!)!
2. Gain comfort and familarity working in R.
3. Gain comfort and familarity working with [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) for analysis and visualization.


## 1. Download the data onto your local machine from our server.
Copy the two files from `/data/project_data/RNAseq/tonsa_play` onto your local machine (scp, Winscp, Fetch, etc.)


## 2 and 3. Import Counts Matrix and Sample ID tables into R and DESeq2 on your local machine!

Now we will work in R on our individual machines.

To get set up:
```R

## Import or install the libraries that we're likely to need
library(DESeq2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(ggpubr)
library(wesanderson)
library(vsn)  ### First: BiocManager::install("vsn") AND BiocManager::install("hexbin")
```
`Tools` -> `Install packages` -> Search for the library of interest; Install including dependencies.

From here, we'll do live coding together... nothing to copy and paste! =)
