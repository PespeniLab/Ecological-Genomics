### Learning Objectives for today!

0. Make sure everyone was able to create the feature table. 
1. Share on systems for keeping well-annotated code or an electronic lab notebook.
2. Articulate the questions we can address and hypotheses we can test with this experimental design.
3. Run analyses, explore the data, and test hypotheses about sunflower sea star microbial diversity!

## 0. Run DADA2 - Filter and denoise data, create feature table.

"Denoising" using [DADA2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27214047/) is a method to filter out noisy sequences, correct errors in marginal sequences, remove chimeric sequences, remove singletons, join denoised paired-end reads, and then dereplicate those sequences.

The features produced by denoising methods are often called “amplicon sequence variant” (ASV). Read this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2017119) and this [blog](https://www.zymoresearch.com/blogs/blog/microbiome-informatics-otu-vs-asv) for a comparison of OTU (operational taxonomic unit) vs. ASV.

Note: the step below is important, big, and takes a long time. Run with a `screen`. Screen is a linux program that allows a long-running task to continue running on a remote machine. See more info [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/).

`screen` to initiate the screen session. Once you are within screen, it's like a new terminal session so you will need to re-lauch Qiime2 and re-export the TMPDIR path.
```
conda activate qiime2-2021.8

export TMPDIR="/data/project_data/16S/tmptmpdir"
echo $TMPDIR

qiime dada2 denoise-paired \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs demux-paired-end.qza \
  --p-n-threads 1 \
  --p-trim-left-f 16 \
  --p-trim-left-r 0 \
  --p-trunc-len-f 289 \
  --p-trunc-len-r 257 \
  --o-table table.qza \
  --o-representative-sequences rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-denoising-stats denoising-stats.qza
  
```
`cntl` + `a` + `d` to detach from a `screen`

`screen -r` to reattach

### Breakdown of the code above:
- qiime dada2 denoise-paired \                       # the command
    - i-demultiplexed-seqs demux-paired-end.qza \    # your input file (CHECK FILENAME)
    - p-n-threads 1 \                                # how many threads or cores to use. We have 24 on the server, so each person can use 1 core
    - p-trim-left-f 16 \                             # how many base pairs to trim from the left of the forward, then reverse reads
    - p-trim-left-r 0 \
    - p-trunc-len-f 289 \                            # which base pair to truncate to at the end of the forward and then reverse reads
    - p-trunc-len-r 257 \
    - o-table table.qza \                            # name your output table (these can be whatever you want! Just keep track)
    - o-representative-sequences rep-seqs.qza \      # name your output representative sequences 
    - o-denoising-stats denoising-stats.qza          # name your stats output file.

DADA2 makes artifacts containing the feature table, corresponding feature sequences, and DADA2 denoising stats. The following code generates summaries of these files.

Let's try writing a script (here, simply a file with a series of commands) to carry out the commands sequentially.

Open and name your script, e.g.: `dada_vis.sh`

```
#!/bin/bash      # tells the computer which language to use

cd ~/myresults   # navigate to where qiime will be able to find the input files below

qiime feature-table summarize \
  --i-table table.qza \
  --o-visualization table.qzv \
  --m-sample-metadata-file pyc_manifest

qiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \
  --i-data rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-visualization rep-seqs.qzv

qiime metadata tabulate \
  --m-input-file denoising-stats.qza \
  --o-visualization denoising-stats.qzv
```

### Copy the `.qzv` files to your local machine to be able to view the results using [Qiime2view](https://view.qiime2.org/)!

## 1. How are you keeping track of what you're doing on the server? Let's share on systems and "best practices."
- Some best practices from a [2015 "Ten Simple Rules" PLoS Comp. Bio. paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385) and more recent and general advice on [Science](https://www.science.org/careers/2019/09/how-keep-lab-notebook) and [NIH](https://www.training.nih.gov/assets/Lab_Notebook_508_(new).pdf).
- Use a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Typora](https://typora.io/) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) or an R markdown file in R studio.
- Integrate/post to your github.

## 2. What questions can we ask/address with these data?

## 3. Calculate alpha and beta diversity and more data analyses!
1. The first step is to **build a phylogentic tree** among all the identified taxa in our samples using `qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree`. This step is not visualized, but the output files will be used to calculate diversity metrics.

```
qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree \
  --i-sequences rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-alignment aligned-rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-masked-alignment masked-aligned-rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-tree unrooted-tree.qza \
  --o-rooted-tree rooted-tree.qza
```

2. **Calculate core diversity metrics:** Qiime2 will calculate a wide range of diversity metrics with one command `qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic`. 
- **But... we need to make one important decision first** - how far down to we want to rarify or subsample our data to set our `--p-sampling-depth`. 
- To make this decision, let's look at the feature counts in the "interactive sample detail" tab of the `table.qzv` using [Qiime2view](https://view.qiime2.org/).
  - At what depth would we start loosing samples? Play with changing the "Metadata category" and drag the "Sampling Depth" bar to see when samples drop off.

### Descriptions of diversity metrics calculated:
- Alpha diversity - "within-sample" diversity
  - Shannon’s diversity index (a quantitative measure of community richness)
  - Observed Features (a qualitative measure of community richness)
  - Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (a qualitiative measure of community richness that **incorporates phylogenetic relationships** between the features)
  - Evenness (or Pielou’s Evenness; a measure of community evenness)
  
  - Test for differences in alpha diversity among groups, correlations with factors.

- Beta diversity - "between-sample" diversity - dissimilarity
  - Jaccard distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity)
  - Bray-Curtis distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity)
  - unweighted UniFrac distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)
  - weighted UniFrac distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features) - *weighted* means it takes into account the abundance of each sequence
  
  - Perform beta diversity ordination using PCoA
  - Test for differences in beta diversity among groups, correlations with factors.

The next command calculates a whole suite of alpha and beta-diversity metrics!
```
qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic \
  --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza \
  --i-table table.qza \
  --p-sampling-depth 13000 \
  --m-metadata-file pyc_manifest \
  --output-dir core-metrics-results
```
An additional beta-diversity statistic that would be worth exploring is the Generalized UniFrac.

Test for associations between categorical metadata columns and alpha diversity data. We’ll do that here for the Faith Phylogenetic Diversity (a measure of community richness) and evenness metrics.

```
qiime diversity alpha-group-significance \
  --i-alpha-diversity core-metrics-results/faith_pd_vector.qza \
  --m-metadata-file pyc_subset_manifest \
  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/faith-pd-group-significance.qzv

qiime diversity alpha-group-significance \
  --i-alpha-diversity core-metrics-results/evenness_vector.qza \
  --m-metadata-file pyc_subset_manifest \
  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/evenness-group-significance.qzv
```

Test for differences in beta diversity between groups:
```
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
  --i-distance-matrix core-metrics-results/weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
  --m-metadata-file pyc_subset_manifest \
  --m-metadata-column site-animal-health \
  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/weighted-unifrac-site-animal-health-significance.qzv \
  --p-pairwise

qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
  --i-distance-matrix core-metrics-results/weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
  --m-metadata-file pyc_subset_manifest \
  --m-metadata-column site-status \
  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/weighted-unifrac-site-status-group-significance.qzv \
  --p-pairwise
```

Let's make an Alpha diversity rarefaction plot! Did we over do the sequencing effort?

```
qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction \
  --i-table table.qza \
  --i-phylogeny rooted-tree.qza \
  --p-max-depth 100000 \
  --m-metadata-file pyc_subset_manifest \
  --o-visualization alpha-rarefaction.qzv
```

### Copy the `.qzv` files to your local machine to be able to view the results using [Qiime2view](https://view.qiime2.org/)!

3. **Assign taxonomies** - who's there?

4. **Test for differential abundance** using ANCOM or gneiss

5. **Export and make pretty plots in R using ggplot2**
